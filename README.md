This repository hosts a comprehensive machine learning system for predicting wine quality based on detailed physicochemical measurements‚Äîsuch as alcohol content, acidity, sulfur levels, and more. The project leverages ensemble modeling (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Neural Networks) to achieve robust performance and uses explainable AI techniques (e.g., SHAP) to provide transparent insights into how each feature impacts the final quality score. By combining these approaches, the solution not only delivers highly accurate predictions of expert ratings but also highlights the key factors driving wine excellence.
